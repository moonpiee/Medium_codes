                "text": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.  It's formed when a massive star collapses at the end of its life.  The star's mass is compressed into an incredibly tiny space, creating a point of infinite density called a singularity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key characteristics:\n\n* **Singularity:** The central point of a black hole where all the mass is concentrated.  Our current understanding of physics breaks down at the singularity.\n\n* **Event Horizon:** The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape.  Once something crosses the event horizon, it's lost forever.  The size of the event horizon is determined by the black hole's mass.\n\n* **Gravitational Field:** Black holes have extremely strong gravitational fields that warp spacetime around them. This warping is what prevents anything from escaping, including light.\n\n* **Mass:** Black holes can have a wide range of masses, from stellar-mass black holes (a few times the mass of the Sun) to supermassive black holes (millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun) found at the centers of galaxies.\n\n* **No Direct Observation:** We can't directly see a black hole because light can't escape it. However, we can observe their effects on surrounding matter and light, such as the way stars orbit them or the way light bends around them (gravitational lensing).\n\nIn short, a black hole is a fascinating and extreme object that represents one of the most profound mysteries in physics.  It's a consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime.\n"
